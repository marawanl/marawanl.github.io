       The Amazon Rainforest boggles the mind with its sheer immensity and extraordinary biodiversity.

 <li>The estimated land area of 2.1 million square miles covers around 40% of South America and part of 9 countries, including Brazil, Columbia, Peru, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, French Guiana, Guyana, and Suriname. Approximately 30% of the world's known species can be found within this enormous and dense region, with new ones being constantly discovered. Unfortunately, deforestation and other habitat destruction have also led to mass extinctions and threaten the existence of many more unique and important species. The current model shows that the Amazon Rainforest is home to 427 mammal species, 1,300 bird species, 378 species of reptiles, and more than 400 species of amphibians. The following is a list of some of the most iconic and curious creatures one can find in the Amazon.

 <p>The jaguar's preternatural beauty and affiliated terror cause admirers and prey to freeze in their tracks. The stand-out spots are similar to the leopards of Africa and Asia, but a small dot in the center is the key point of differentiation. The jaguar (Panthera onca) is the biggest cat in the Americas and the third biggest in the world (behind lions and tigers). These magnificent carnivores are solitary but effective night hunters, both on land and water. They have even been known to attack caimans. Jaguars are classified as "Near Threatened" (NT) on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List. Since the 1880s, they have lost nearly half of their territory, now mostly relying on the Amazon Basin and some parts of Central America. They also face threats from poachers and retaliatory killings by cattle ranchers.</p>
 
 
 <strong>SLOTH</strong> <img id="hey_hey" src="https://www.worldatlas.com/r/w768/upload/89/f6/ed/shutterstock-604143956.jpg" width="350">
 <p>These loveable slow-pokes also mostly keep to the rainforest canopy. They tend to sleep between 15 to 20 hours a day, and when it is time to feed, they cover a whopping 40 yards, collecting leaves, twigs, and buds along the way. Despite their morose movements, sloths always seem to have a smile on their face. They even enjoy a leisurely swim from time to time - putting those long, tree-hanging arms to secondary use. There are two different types of sloths, two-toed and three-toed, and six species (all of which are found within the tropical rain forests of Central and South America). Of these, the pygmy three-toed sloth (Bradypus pygmaeus), is listed as "Critically Endangered" (CR), and the maned sloth (Bradypus torquatus) is classified as "Vulnerable" (VU).
